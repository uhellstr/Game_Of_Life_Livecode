GAME OF LIFE

This is Conway's Game Of Life written in LiveCode (runrev) version  7.0.1

- To compile code you must use LiveCode version 7.0.X or higher
- Download LiveCode community version from
  http://downloads.livecode.com/livecode/

Tested environments:
- OSX Yousemity
- Linux compiled in 32-bit mode since we require sqllite libraries provided by

Note:
No support yet for mobile platform Android that is TODO
Has not been tested on Windows due to lack of that environment.
